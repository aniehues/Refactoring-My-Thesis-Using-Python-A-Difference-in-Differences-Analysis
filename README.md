# Economic Impact Analysis using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) — Python

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based replication of my bachelor thesis, originally performed in Stata. The goal was to assess the **economic impact** of the installation of a chicken processing factory by **Seara** in **Itapiranga (SC, Brazil)** in 2001. I used the **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** method to estimate the causal effect on GDP per capita.

## Objective

Analyze whether the factory investment led to economic growth in Itapiranga using **São Carlos** (a similar municipality) as the control group.

## Methodology

- **Treatment group:** Itapiranga
- **Control group:** São Carlos
- **Intervention year:** 2001
- **Indicator:** GDP per capita
- **Statistical method:** Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- **Model:** Linear regression using OLS

---

## Key Findings

- ✅ **DiD coefficient = 19.17**  
- ✅ **Statistically significant (p < 0.001)**  
- ✅ Suggests a **strong positive effect** of the factory on the local economy  
- ✅ Supports **Export Base Theory (North, 1977)** and **Circular Cumulative Causation (Myrdal, 1972)**
